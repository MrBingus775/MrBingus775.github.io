## What is Pantheon Insights?
<!-- 
The tectonic plates of geopolitics are shifting as multilateral fissures are transforming the global landscape of trade, finance, and politics. In short, we are in a new phase of globalization. Countries are now reevaluating their reliance on foreign suppliers, seeking to secure critical resources to safeguard their economies, and accelerating investment in strategic technologies. As these risks grow, markets, economies, and nation states are being forced to navigate a complex landscape where uncertainty and volatility are no longer the exception, but the rule.
<br/><br/>
Looking ahead, geopolitics will play an even larger role as emerging powers, regional conflicts, and technological competition shape a new global paradigm that demands adaptive strategies. Pantheon Insights leverages OSINT research methods and data to analyze how these secular trends impact global business operations, cross-border capital flows, and economic dynamism. We specialize in generating actionable research in geopolitics, markets, and economies to give business leaders a competitive edge for navigating the political economy of the new global paradigm.
